### This is my personal Website and The whole idea revolves around two things which are often considered as two different poles of Globe:

  1. Technology: You cant keep a Mechanic away from its tools right? Being a Computer Science Engineer even I cant keep my tools away. I will share the little knowledge of each such tool which I have and leave the rest to you to explore.

  2. Blogging: I will not try to teach you anything but rather try to put forward my opinion on certain aspects of Life. I also share ideas and techniques from my personal experience of observing the things present around all of us which we might fail to observe sometimes.
